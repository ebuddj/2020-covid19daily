## Confirmed coronavirus cases per population in Europe countries (EBU)

This map shows the cumulative number for 14 days of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population in Europe from 1st July to 13th August included. The value for each country is presented on the map with a number and a circle corresponding to the value. The circle radius is calculated with a logarithmic scale.

In this period Sweden has gone from 147 cumulative cases in 14 days per 100,000 population to 35. France on the other hand has gone from 10 to 32 and Germany from 9 to 14. This raw data is available for all countries.

The data has been sourced from [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases).
